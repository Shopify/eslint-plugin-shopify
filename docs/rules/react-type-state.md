# Requires that React component state be typed in TypeScript. (react-type-state)

TypeScript will not correctly check your state instance property against the state declared in the componentâ€™s type initialization unless an explicit type annotation is provided. This rule enforces that the type annotation is provided when it detects a meaningful state type in a TypeScript React component.

## Rule Details

The following pattern is considered a warning:

```ts
class MyComponent extends React.Component<{}, State> {
  state = {};
}
```

The following patterns are not warnings:

```ts
class MyComponent extends React.Component<Props, never> {}
class MyComponent extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  state: State = {};
}
```
